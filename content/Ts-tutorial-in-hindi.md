# Introduction

TypeScript is a powerful, strongly typed language built on top of JavaScript. It adds static typing to your code, making it easier to catch errors during development.

# Why Use TypeScript?

- Type safety
- Better tooling (auto-complete, refactoring, etc.)
- Improved maintainability
- Supports modern JavaScript features

# Example

```ts
function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}`;
}
